The Permissions page gives you a comprehensive look at who currently has access to your tables. As a table administrator, you have full control over access levels, allowing you to decide who can view or interact with specific data.

## Managing Permissions

As an administrator, you can easily manage user access:

1. <strong>To add new users</strong>: Click <strong>Add Users</strong>, enter their email, and select the permission type they need. Eff BI makes it simple to bring collaborators onboard with the right level of access.

2. <strong>To remove access</strong>: Just click the <strong>Remove</strong> button next to any user you wish to revoke access for, giving you full control over data visibility.

If you have <strong>view-only permissions</strong>, you’ll still be able to see access rights but won’t be able to modify them.
