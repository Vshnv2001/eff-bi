## Table Permissions

The Permissions page offers a detailed view of your current access rights. As an administrator of a table, you have the authority to modify access levels, allowing you to manage who can view the table.

## Managing Permissions

As a table administrator, you have the authority to adjust user access. You can revoke existing permissions with the 'Remove' button or extend access by selecting 'Add Users' and entering your colleagues' email with the respective permission type.

If you only have 'view' permissions for that table, you will not be able to give or revoke the permission of others.
