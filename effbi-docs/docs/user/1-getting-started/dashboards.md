This guide will provide you everything you need to start creating charts and visualizations!

## Dashboards: Your Window into Data Insights

Dashboards in Eff BI bring your data to life, helping you visualize interactions, trends, and key insights at a glance. Start creating your own by following these steps:

1. Go to the Dashboards page.

2. Click the <strong>Create Dashboard</strong> button at the bottom left of the screen.

3. Enter your dashboard name and an optional description of the dashboard.

4. Click on <strong>Create Dashboard</strong>.

This will set up a customizable space where you can add Charts. Charts is a blanket term we use to refer to individual graphs, tables or visual elements that display your data insights.

## Creating Charts

Charts are the building blocks of your dashboard. They display data as graphs or other visuals, giving you a powerful way to see and interpret your data.

2. Inside your dashboard, click <strong>Create Chart</strong> to add a new Chart.

3. <strong>Name Your Chart</strong> and optionally choose your chart type to pick the visualization that best tells your data’s story.

4. <strong>Add Visualization Instructions</strong>: Simply type in your insights request in natural language, Eff BI will take it from there and generate your visual!

5. Not sure about your data's structure? <strong>Easily check your tables and columns</strong> on the left panel to get familiar with your data sources.

6. Click <strong>Generate Preview</strong> and let Eff BI do the work. Your preview will be ready in less than a minute, so take a quick coffee break if you’d like!

7. Want a different view? <strong>Refine your chart</strong> by adjusting the Visualization Instructions and clicking Generate Preview again. Repeat until you’re satisfied with the results.

8. Once you’re happy with the chart, click <strong>Save</strong> to keep it permanently on your dashboard.

And that's it! You’re ready to explore your data with impactful visuals.
