The Permissions page gives you a comprehensive look at who currently has access to your tables. As a table administrator, you have full control over access levels, allowing you to decide who can view or interact with specific data.

:::warning

Table permissions apply to read-only access. Data editing is not available within Eff BI.

## Managing Permissions

As an administrator, you can easily manage user access:

1. <strong>To add new users</strong>: Click <strong>Add Users</strong>, enter their email, and select the permission type they need. Eff BI makes it simple to bring collaborators onboard with the right level of access.

:::info
Before granting table permissions to a user, ensure they have created an account with Eff BI and joined your organization.

To join the organization, simply share your Organization Code with them when they sign up. The Organization Code can be found in the User Profile tab, accessible via the dropdown menu under the User Icon on the top right of the navigation bar.
:::

2. <strong>To remove access</strong>: Just click the <strong>Remove</strong> button next to any user you wish to revoke access for, giving you full control over data visibility.

If you have <strong>view-only permissions</strong> on a table, youâ€™ll only be able to see the data but not modify or view the access rights.
