# Welcome to our Blog

Here, we dive deep into the technical decisions and feature implementations that power Eff BI. As an open-source project, we’re excited to share our journey, from the architectural choices we made to the challenges we solved, so other developers can gain insights, understand our approach, and build on top of our existing architecture.

These blogs aim to give you a behind-the-scenes look at our development process. We hope these posts provide value, inspire collaboration, and serve as a practical resource for anyone interested in data visualization, open-source development, and modern software design.

Thank you for joining us on this journey. Let’s build something amazing together!
