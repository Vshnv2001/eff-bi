Eff BI was built with a modern tech stack designed to ensure high performance, scalability, and a seamless user experience. Here’s an overview of the key technologies and the reasons behind these choices:

## Frontend

We used <strong>React with TypeScript</strong>, leveraging Vite for its fast bundling and development experience. For our component library, we chose <strong>Material-Tailwind</strong> to provide a cohesive design system that’s both flexible and visually appealing, ensuring an intuitive and responsive UI.

## Backend

The backend is powered by <strong>Django in Python</strong>, with <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> as our database. Django was selected for its robust framework, which allows for rapid development, scalability, and ease of integration with PostgreSQL for reliable data storage.

## Authentication & Authorization

We integrated <strong>SuperTokens</strong> for managing authentication and authorization. SuperTokens provides a secure and scalable solution that streamlines user management while keeping data secure.

## LLM Model

We utilize <strong>GPT-4</strong> as the language model (LLM) to generate SQL code and create AI summaries of your data. By harnessing GPT-4’s advanced language capabilities, we enable users to input natural language queries, which are then dynamically converted into SQL, allowing for powerful and flexible data insights without requiring deep technical knowledge.
