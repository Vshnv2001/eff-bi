    question: "What does Admin permission mean?",
    answer:
      "Permissions are applied on the table level, where each user can have no access, view access or admin access to a table. If a user has admin permissions, they would be able to view the data in the table and grant other users view or admin permissions. View permission simply means that the user can only view the data.",

    question: "Why am I getting no permissions error when creating a tile?",
    answer:
      "This means that in your query to create a tile, the query requires information from a table that you do not have access to. Reach out to an admin in your organization to grant you permissions to that table to overcome this issue.",

    question: "Why am I unable to update my database URI?",
    answer:
      "Our system only supports 1 database URI per organization at the moment. As such, if your organization has previously added a database URI, the SAVE button will be disabled.

  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I rename a table in the database?",
    answer:
      "Upon renaming a table in your database and refreshing, the renamed table is treated as a new table and the original table is deleted. " +
      "Consequently all user-specific permissions linked to the original table will be deleted.\n" +
      "The new table will be added as a fresh entry with admin permissions set only for your organization's Super Admins.",
  },
