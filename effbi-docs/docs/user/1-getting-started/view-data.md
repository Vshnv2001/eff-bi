## Quick Glance of your Existing Data

After connecting your database, explore your tables by navigating to the 'Data' tab. Here, you can preview sample data from your accessible tables, providing a quick snapshot of the information.

This also includes an AI generated summary of your data, to give you a quick refresher
of what the data in your tables entail!

## Refreshing your Data

At the bottom right of the Data page, you will see a Refresh button. This refresh button is used to take a new snapshot of your data which will allow Eff BI to have access to your latest data. You should refresh in the event that you made some changes to your original database.
